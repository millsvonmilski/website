As Community Manager you will be responsible for making sure ustwo games maintains a friendly and enthusiastic online presence. You are excited by the prospect of engaging with our diverse fan base, and can plan and deliver content specifically suited each of our social media channels.

As part of maintaining our online presence, you will also lead the way in pitching and creating unique content for our development blog, including updates from within the studio, and more general pieces about games and the games industry.

You will be the main public point of contact in our support team, using Zendesk to manage and streamline the support strategies for each game in our back catalogue, working with our technical team to highlight bugs, and making sure players’ issues are resolved.
