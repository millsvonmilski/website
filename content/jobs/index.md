ustwo games is still a small company, but we’re constantly seeking to challenge ourselves with the games we make, and in turn build an even better team.

We’re not your average games company and sit within a much larger group of creative studios focussing on digital product design. It’s this uncommon heritage of ours that we believe contributes to our innovative thinking and we embrace applications from outside the traditional games industry. How do we make games that don’t feel like games? We take inspiration from outside of games.

We seek team members to add to our already diverse group and hope to attract people with a wide variety of interests and backgrounds. Extracurricular activities we already pursue include books, board games and a wide range of other socialising events.
